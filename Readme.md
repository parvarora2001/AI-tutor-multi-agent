# AI Tutor Project (Open-Source, Free)

This project simulates an **AI-powered tutoring system** with three agents:
- **Teaching Agent** → explains topics in simple terms
- **Grading Agent** → evaluates student answers
- **Feedback Agent** → provides constructive feedback

### Why?
Agentic AI (multi-agent workflows) is in demand (2025). This project showcases orchestration, NLP, and evaluation skills — all with open-source models (no API cost).

### Stack
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- Basic Python NLP

### How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
